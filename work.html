          Work Experience
        </div>
        <div class="section-description">
          <p>Through my career as a developer, I’ve worked in 5 different full time positions. My front end skills were put to the test at my most recent coop where I had to implement a front end feature using a virtual DOM and reactive programming. My code architecture skills were further developed through one of my jobs, as I was put on a project where I was one of the lead developers. I was able to work very closely with a talented designer to build a <b>MEAN</b> app solution from the ground up. In terms of freelance experience, recently, I’ve been working on a solution for a new startup with a talented colleague of mine. We went through a rigorous process of finding a solution for the startup, building pipelines to attract and retain clients, and designing the user experience all from scratch. Through all my experience, I’ve gained a bit of business insight on how a company functions, as well as a lot of technical skill to go with it. In this section, I will be describing my professional work experience. For a more condensed version, you can see my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a></p>

          <p>At Axiom Zen, I was placed on the ZenHub team</p>
          <p>ZenHub is a project management solution for GitHub Users. It essentially puts all of the great aspects of project management tools right where your developers spend most of their time.</p>
          <p>One of my most proud moments was the launch of Epics. Epics is a common concept in project management. It is essentially a collection of project management tasks (in this case, GitHub Issues). This was one of the biggest features that ZenHub had release to date, and since I was one of the main developers on this feature, it was great to see it go live.</p>
          <p>During my work at ZenHub, I had a chance to work with reactive programming and a virtual DOM library, which further expanded my knowledge of different types of front end architecture. I was also able to use a rather interesting functional library called Ramda, where I was introduced to the concept of function currying. These experiences have continued to help me improve my skills as a software developer.</p>
          <p>At Axiom Zen, I attended a variety of hacking events in my spare time. This year, I had participated at VanHacks on behalf of Axiom Zen. In the end, we were able to create Eva, an end to end personal security solution. How this worked was that a user would be able to press a help button in order to notify a security company of their current coordinates, as well as pictures taken (silently) that could be used for evidence. I worked on the front end display of the coordinates and images using the Google Maps API and Socket IO. More information can be found <a href="https://www.axiomzen.co/news/article/need-help-just-knock">here</a>.</p>
          <p>I was also given the opportunity to learn how to develop games for Virtual Reality. We were able to make a simple game (where a player can jump on moving platforms to reach the final platform) with the Samsung Gear, which was a valuable experience.</p>

        <div class="section-description">
          <p>I was apart of the Nexj Health team working on a product called Connected Wellness, a wellness solution using wearable technology.</p>
          <p>In order to better understand patients, Connected Wellness allowed "Assessments" to be assigned by a health care professional (HCP) so that they can better evaluate the patient's current health. Assessments are pre- and post- clinical surveys that are given to a patient to increase the efficiency of the appointment. Assessments would be scored to determine what state the individual's health is in, and then added to a group according to the results. I mainly worked on the team responsible for making an those assessments. I also implemented most of the scoring logic for the assessments.</p>
          <p>In addition to the assessments, I was able to modify and add mobile responsive features in other parts of the app.</p>
          <p>At Nexj Health, I also spent some time fixing server side issues. I used tools such as Kibana, Fiddler and the Node Inspector to analyze data and various http requests. In order to sufficiently test the security of the app, I needed to intercept http requests, modify the request, and resend it in order to try to use the app in ways it wasn't meant to be used.</p>

          <p>As a Front End JavaScript Intern, I was given the opportunity to work on the common UI framework used by various other Genesys applications. I contributed some new features, as well as improved older ones. I implemented front end unit tests using Jasmine to ensure robust code for the UI modules.</p>
          <p>One other project I was working on was an application that connected a single user to all of their various Genesys applications. I focused on building new UI features on the front end view using AngularJS.</p>
          <p>In addition, I was put on a project where I acted as one of the lead developers. The project was to remake a MEAN web application that would showcase the new and old features of the UI framework. I had a lead role in developing the architecture towards the MEAN application. I worked very closely with a talented designer to come up with various solutions to display information in a user friendly way.</p>
