          <p>Through my career, I've had 7 internships. Professionally, I started out as a front end developer, but I've been more interested in backend work recently. In this section, I will be describing my professional work experience. For a more condensed version, you can see my <a href="resume.pdf">resume.</a></p>

          <p>My second internship at Yelp was focused on backend work.</p>
          <p>I mostly worked with data processing on the Transactions team. There were many questions we wanted to answer with our food order data, but they weren't feasible because of the number of slow MySQL database queries that would have to be called to answer those questions. We needed a faster way to provide answers to our users. I worked on a joint project with my mentor called Fast Reorders. We wanted to give useful information to our users about their previous orders, so we utilized <a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/10/redshift-connector.html">Yelp's DataPipeline</a> to take our orders from Kafka and insert them into Elastic Search.</p>
          <p>I worked on various message processing applications (Yelp calls these "Spolts") that transforms orders in our Kafka topic to something more useful. For example, I wrote a Spolt to take an order, find the latitude and longitude, and then output the new geolocated order back into a downstream Kafka topic. This would be useful to find reorders near a user's location.</p>
          <p>One other thing that I worked on was an auditing batch that would find missing orders from Elastic Search. It would then proceed to insert the missing orders back into Elastic Search.</p>

          <p>At Yelp, I was on the Transactions team.</p>
          <p>The Transactions team was responsible for closely connecting users and businesses through delivery and pickup (and other services as well). Third party partners work with us to provide the delivery of the service directly to the customers.</p>
          <p>During these four months, I refactored our team's frontend pages into our own frontend service. Yelp's codebase was at one point a single monolithic app, and in the last couple of years, there has been a great effort to move parts of that monolithic app into their own separate service to improve scalability. However, most of our team's frontend pages were still stuck in the main Yelp app. We wanted to have our own service so that we could fully control the deployment and development of our own frontend pages.</p>
          <p>The Transactions team had its own development playground called the Platform Playground. It allows us to test our order flow end to end by creating development docker containers and configuring the ports to point to each other instead of the regular development containers. This allowed us to test new changes in multiple services with little effort, and it allowed for simple acceptance testing as well. The Transactions team had never integrated a frontend service into the playground, so I was responsible for this.</p>
          <p>This project gave me an opportunity to actually work with every part of the service. I integrated it into the testing suite, wrote docker files, set up dashboards for service monitoring and log ingestion, and refactored the frontend pages.</p>

        <div class="section-description">
          <p>At Axiom Zen, I was placed on the ZenHub team</p>
          <p>ZenHub is a project management solution for GitHub Users. It essentially puts all of the great aspects of project management tools right where your developers spend most of their time.</p>
          <p>One of my most proud moments was the launch of Epics. Epics is a common concept in project management. It is essentially a collection of project management tasks (in this case, GitHub Issues). This was one of the biggest features that ZenHub had release to date, and since I was one of the main developers on this feature, it was great to see it go live.</p>
          <p>During my work at ZenHub, I had a chance to work with reactive programming and a virtual DOM library, which further expanded my knowledge of different types of front end architecture. I was also able to use a rather interesting functional library called Ramda, where I was introduced to the concept of function currying. These experiences have continued to help me improve my skills as a software developer.</p>
          <p>At Axiom Zen, I attended a variety of hacking events in my spare time. This year, I had participated at VanHacks on behalf of Axiom Zen. In the end, we were able to create Eva, an end to end personal security solution. How this worked was that a user would be able to press a help button in order to notify a security company of their current coordinates, as well as pictures taken (silently) that could be used for evidence. I worked on the front end display of the coordinates and images using the Google Maps API and Socket IO. More information can be found <a href="https://www.axiomzen.co/news/article/need-help-just-knock">here</a>.</p>
          <p>I was also given the opportunity to learn how to develop games for Virtual Reality. We were able to make a simple game (where a player can jump on moving platforms to reach the final platform) with the Samsung Gear, which was a valuable experience.</p>

        <div class="section-description">
          <p>I was part of the Nexj Health team working on a product called Connected Wellness, a wellness solution using wearable technology.</p>
          <p>In order to better understand patients, Connected Wellness allowed "Assessments" to be assigned by a health care professional (HCP) so that they can better evaluate the patient's current health. Assessments are pre- and post- clinical surveys that are given to a patient to increase the efficiency of the appointment. Assessments would be scored to determine what state the individual's health is in, and then added to a group according to the results. I mainly worked on the team responsible for making an those assessments. I also implemented most of the scoring logic for the assessments.</p>
          <p>In addition to the assessments, I was able to modify and add mobile responsive features in other parts of the app.</p>
          <p>At Nexj Health, I also spent some time fixing server side issues. I used tools such as Kibana, Fiddler and the Node Inspector to analyze data and various http requests. In order to sufficiently test the security of the app, I needed to intercept http requests, modify the request, and resend it in order to try to use the app in ways it wasn't meant to be used.</p>

          <p>As a Front End JavaScript Intern, I was given the opportunity to work on the common UI framework used by various other Genesys applications. I contributed some new features, as well as improved older ones. I implemented front end unit tests using Jasmine to ensure robust code for the UI modules.</p>
          <p>One other project I was working on was an application that connected a single user to all of their various Genesys applications. I focused on building new UI features on the front end view using AngularJS.</p>
          <p>In addition, I was put on a project where I acted as one of the lead developers. The project was to remake a MEAN web application that would showcase the new and old features of the UI framework. I had a lead role in developing the architecture towards the MEAN application. I worked very closely with a talented designer to come up with various solutions to display information in a user friendly way.</p>
