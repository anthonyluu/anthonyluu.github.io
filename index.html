				About Me
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>I like to develop solutions.</p>
				<p>I’m a student at the University of Waterloo, studying to become a computer engineer. I’ve developed software at various companies in the past, ranging from a small startup sized company, to a large publically traded company. I’ve contributed to a few side projects, as well as attended a variety of hackathons in my spare time. In terms of extracurricular, I enjoy bouldering and I am an active member of the table tennis club.</p>
				<p>On this website, I will talk about a bit of my experience, highlight the side projects I’ve worked on, and showcase a few of my hackathon projects.</p>

					Work Experience
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>Through my career as a developer, I’ve worked in 5 different full time positions. My front end skills were put to the test at my most recent coop where I had to implement a front end feature using a virtual DOM and reactive programming. My code architecture skills were further developed through one of my jobs, as I was put on a project where I was one of the lead developers. I was able to work very closely with a talented designer to build a <b>MEAN</b> app solution from the ground up. In terms of freelance experience, recently, I’ve been working on a solution for a new startup with a talented colleague of mine. We went through a rigorous process of finding a solution for the startup, building pipelines to attract and retain clients, and designing the user experience all from scratch. Through all my experience, I’ve gained a bit of business insight on how a company functions, as well as a lot of technical skill to go with it. In this section, I will be describing my professional work experience. For a more condensed version, you can see my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a></p>

					<b>Software Engineering</b> - Axiom Zen
				</div>
				<div class="date-range">
					January 2016 - April 2016
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>At Axiom Zen, I was placed on the ZenHub team</p>
					<p>ZenHub is a project management solution for GitHub Users. It essentially puts all of the great aspects of project management tools right where your developers spend most of their time.</p>
					<p>One of my most proud moments was the launch of Epics. Epics is a common concept in project management. It is essentially a collection of project management tasks (in this case, GitHub Issues). This was one of the biggest features that ZenHub had release to date, and since I was one of the main developers on this feature, it was great to see it go live.</p>
					<p>During my work at ZenHub, I had a chance to work with reactive programming and a virtual DOM library, which further expanded my knowledge of different types of front end architecture. I was also able to use a rather interesting functional library called Ramda, where I was introduced to the concept of function currying. These experiences have continued to help me improve my skills as a software developer.</p>
					<p>At Axiom Zen, I attended a variety of hacking events in my spare time. This year, I had participated at VanHacks on behalf of Axiom Zen. In the end, we were able to create Eva, an end to end personal security solution. How this worked was that a user would be able to press a help button in order to notify a security company of their current coordinates, as well as pictures taken (silently) that could be used for evidence. I worked on the front end display of the coordinates and images using the Google Maps API and Socket IO. More information can be found <a href="https://www.axiomzen.co/news/article/need-help-just-knock">here</a>.</p>
					<p>I was also given the opportunity to learn how to develop games for Virtual Reality. We were able to make a simple game (where a player can jump on moving platforms to reach the final platform) with the Samsung Gear, which was a valuable experience.</p>
					<p><b class="theme-color">Tools used</b>: JS, Git, Backbone, Snabbdom, Flyd, Ramda, JSX, Handlebars, Sass, NodeJS, MongoDb, Webpack</p>

					<b>Software Engineering Intern</b> - Nexj Systems
				</div>
				<div class="date-range">
					May 2015 - August 2015
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>I was apart of the Nexj Health team working on a product called Connected Wellness, a wellness solution using wearable technology.</p>
					<p>In order to better understand patients, Connected Wellness allowed "Assessments" to be assigned by a health care professional (HCP) so that they can better evaluate the patient's current health. Assessments are pre- and post- clinical surveys that are given to a patient to increase the efficiency of the appointment. Assessments would be scored to determine what state the individual's health is in, and then added to a group according to the results. I mainly worked on the team responsible for making an those assessments. I also implemented most of the scoring logic for the assessments.</p>
					<p>In addition to the assessments, I was able to modify and add mobile responsive features in other parts of the app.</p>
					<p>At Nexj Health, I also spent some time fixing server side issues. I used tools such as Kibana, Fiddler and the Node Inspector to analyze data and various http requests. In order to sufficiently test the security of the app, I needed to intercept http requests, modify the request, and resend it in order to try to use the app in ways it wasn't meant to be used.</p>
					<p><b class="theme-color">Tools used</b>: JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, Less, Mercurial, SOA, Vagrant, Kibana, Fiddler</p>

					<b>Front End JavaScript Intern</b> - Genesys
				</div>
				<div class="date-range">
					September 2014 - December 2014
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>As a Front End JavaScript Intern, I was given the opportunity to work on the common UI framework used by various other Genesys applications. I contributed some new features, as well as improved older ones. I implemented front end unit tests using Jasmine to ensure robust code for the UI modules.</p>
					<p>One other project I was working on was an application that connected a single user to all of their various Genesys applications. I focused on building new UI features on the front end view using AngularJS.</p>
					<p>In addition, I was put on a project where I acted as one of the lead developers. The project was to remake a MEAN web application that would showcase the new and old features of the UI framework. I had a lead role in developing the architecture towards the MEAN application. I worked very closely with a talented designer to come up with various solutions to display information in a user friendly way.</p>

				<div class="section-description">
					<p>Here is a list of side projects that I’ve worked on in the past few years.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sub-section-title">
					<b>TurnBasedStrategyGame</b> - Unity 3D Project (See the project <a href="https://github.com/anthonyluu/TurnBasedStrategyGame">here</a>)
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>Recently, I’ve been working on a Fire Emblem - like game. A simple turn based strategy game made with the <b>Unity 3D</b> engine. I started with this game to introduce myself into the world of game development. This game uses various algorithms and techniques to generate a map and guide an AI enemy to attack a player. Through this project, I’ve gained proficiency with the <b>C#</b> language, as well as valuable knowledge on the code architecture and development lifecycles found in game development.</p>

					<b>AndroidWearLift</b> - Android Library (See the project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>)
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>AndroidWearLift is an android library that aims to improve the workout experience of <b>Android Wear</b> user. The idea was conceived at the Communitech 24hr Startup Hackathon, where I worked with a team of developers to create a simple android app that counts the repetitions of various exercises (such as bicep curls or shoulder flies). After the hackathon, we wanted to take what we learned to create a library out of it.</p>

					Hackathon Experience
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>I've been to a couple of hackathons in the past. Here's an overview of what was done for each project</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sub-section-title">
					<b>WatchMe (AndroidWearLift)</b> - Communitech 24hr Startup (See the newer library project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>)
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>This was my very first hackathon. Its focus was not on a hack, but on developing and selling an idea. During this hackathon, I was able to learn about the aspects that make a solution successful. Whether it was the user experience, the business plan, or even the idea of the solution itself, we were given heavy critique by a variety of startup founders. Through this hackathon, I've come to develop a bit more of a business sense, and a greater understanding of what a product really is.</p>
					<p>During this hackathon, we created an early version of what is currently known as AndroidWearLift. WatchMe was the android implementation of AndroidWearLift before we decided to strip out our logic and make it a library. You can read about the details of the library above, or at the github repository <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>.</p>

				<div class="sub-section-title">
					<b>Muse Music Player</b> - WearHacks
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>WearHacks was a hackathon that focused on the use of leading wearable technology. Some devices made available to us were the Nod Ring, the Myo armband and even the Muse Brain Sensing Headband. Out of all the innovative wearable tech available, my team decided to work with the Muse.</p>
					<p>With the Muse, we wanted to create something simple and smart. The muse is able to read brainwaves, which means that it can, to an extent, read a person's behaviour or emotion. We decided to make a music player that will automatically generate an ideal playlist for a user based on previous analysis performed while they listened to various tracks.</p>
					<p> This is how it worked:</p>
					<li>A user will listen to each song in the list once.</li>
					<li>Using the Muse, we will record and determine if the user has enjoyed the song or not.</li>
					<li>After the user has finished listening to all the songs, the app will take all the songs with the highest scores and add them to the ideal playlist.</li>
					<p>In order to determine how different brainwaves (alpha, beta, gamma, etc) map to behaviour, we performed a number of tests with an individual wearing the device. We then recorded the muse readings and used <b>Matlab</b> and differential calculus to remove noise and analyze the signals. In the end, we were able to somewhat determine a general idea of what signal patterns map to the emotion "Joy".</p>
					<p>In the end, we didnt have time to complete the project (we realized that we weren't using the correct android library version, so it didn't fully work), but we had gained practical experience in signal analysis, which was still a very valuable asset in my opinion.</p>

				<div class="sub-section-title">
					<b>ChallengeHub</b> - BattleHack (See the project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/challenge-site">here</a>)
				</div>
				<div class="section-description">
					<p>At BattleHack, we wanted to solve a problem that we've experienced. We wanted to create a more efficient and solid way of assessing a developer's skills that will replace the nerve-racking whiteboard interviews. We realized that a lot of very skilled developers may not perform at their best during the pressure of a whiteboard test in an interview. What we created was a way to assess the potential employee using a company's own code base.</p>
					<p>ChallengeHub is a github integrated application that allows for companies to send out "Challenges" with an option of a monetary incentive. These challenges would be a chance to fix a but or add a new feature to the company's open source code. It was created using <b>ReactJS</b> for frontend, and <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> as a backend. <b>Braintree</b> was also integrated as the payment system.</p>
					<p>In the perspective of an employer, they would benefit from the ability to test a developer in the environment where they will be working. Being able to see the exact implementation style of a potential developer is a great asset for an employer. Developers would also benefit from having their full skills exposed by showing what they can do in an real development environment.</p>
