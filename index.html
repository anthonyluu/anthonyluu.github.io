				About Me
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>I like to develop solutions.</p>
				<p>I’m a student at the University of Waterloo, studying to become a computer engineer. I’ve developed software at various companies in the past, ranging from a small startup sized company, to a large publically traded company. I’ve contributed to a few side projects, as well as attended a variety of hackathons in my spare time. In terms of extracurricular, I enjoy bouldering and I am an active member of the table tennis club</p>
				<p>On this website, I will talk about a bit of my experience, highlight the side projects i’ve worked on, and showcase a few of my hackathon projects.</p>

				Work Experience
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Through my career as a developer, I’ve worked in 4 different full time positions. My code architecture skills were further developed through one of my jobs, as I was put on a project where I was one of the lead developers. I was able to work very closely with a talented designer to build a MEAN app solution from the ground up. In terms of freelance experience, recently, I’ve been working on a solution for a new startup with a talented colleague of mine. We went through a rigorous process of finding a solution for the startup, building pipelines to attract and retain clients, and designing the user experience all from scratch. Through all my experience, I’ve gained a bit of business insight on how a company functions, as well as a lot of technical skill to go with it. For more information, see my resume.</p>
