				About Me
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>I like to develop solutions.</p>
				<p>I’m a student at the University of Waterloo, studying to become a computer engineer. I’ve developed software at various companies in the past, ranging from a small startup sized company, to a large publically traded company. I’ve contributed to a few side projects, as well as attended a variety of hackathons in my spare time. In terms of extracurricular, I enjoy bouldering and I am an active member of the table tennis club.</p>
				<p>On this website, I will talk about a bit of my experience, highlight the side projects I’ve worked on, and showcase a few of my hackathon projects.</p>

				Work Experience
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Through my career as a developer, I’ve worked in 4 different full time positions. My code architecture skills were further developed through one of my jobs, as I was put on a project where I was one of the lead developers. I was able to work very closely with a talented designer to build a <b>MEAN</b> app solution from the ground up. In terms of freelance experience, recently, I’ve been working on a solution for a new startup with a talented colleague of mine. We went through a rigorous process of finding a solution for the startup, building pipelines to attract and retain clients, and designing the user experience all from scratch. Through all my experience, I’ve gained a bit of business insight on how a company functions, as well as a lot of technical skill to go with it. For more information, see my <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

				Side Projects
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Here is a list of side projects that I’ve worked on in the past few years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section-title">
				<b>TurnBasedStrategyGame</b> - Unity 3D Project (See the project <a href="https://github.com/anthonyluu/TurnBasedStrategyGame">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Recently, I’ve been working on a Fire Emblem - like game. A simple turn based strategy game made with the <b>Unity 3D</b> engine. I started with this game to introduce myself into the world of game development. This game uses various algorithms and techniques to generate a map and guide an AI enemy to attack a player. Through this project, I’ve gained proficiency with the <b>C#</b> language, as well as valuable knowledge on the code architecture and development lifecycles found in game development.</p>

				<b>AndroidWearLift</b> - Android Library (See the project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>AndroidWearLift is an android library that aims to improve the workout experience of <b>Android Wear</b> user. The idea was conceived at the Communitech 24hr Startup Hackathon, where I worked with a team of developers to create a simple android app that counts the repetitions of various exercises (such as bicep curls or shoulder flies). After the hackathon, we wanted to take what we learned to create a library out of it.</p>

			<div class="sub-section-title">
				<b>Feed Me</b> - Ionic News Reader (See the project <a href="https://github.com/anthonyluu/feedMe-IonicNews">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Feed Me is an RSS news reader made using <b>Ionic</b> and <b>Material Design</b>. This weekend project was made to learn about the capabilities that <b>Ionic</b> offered. A user is allowed to add supported RSS feeds to their main feed, where they can view stories based on their interests. This is currently supported on <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> devices.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section-title">
				<b>Park It</b> - Android App (See the project <a href="https://github.com/anthonyluu/Park-it">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>Park-it is an app that I made to familiarize myself with <b>Android</b> development, using Toronto Open Data as a resource. It provides a list of the closest parking lots to your current position. Selecting an item on the list will bring up a google maps fragment, which will display the location, the capacity of the lot, as well as the associated price rate.</p>

				Hackathon Experience
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>I've been to a couple of hackathons in the past. Here's an overview of what was done for each project</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section-title">
				<b>WatchMe (AndroidWearLift)</b> - Communitech 24hr Startup (See the newer library project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>This was my very first hackathon. Its focus was not on a hack, but on developing and selling an idea. During this hackathon, I was able to learn about the aspects that make a solution successful. Whether it was the user experience, the business plan, or even the idea of the solution itself, we were given heavy critique by a variety of startup founders. Through this hackathon, I've come to develop a bit more of a business sense, and a greater understanding of what a product really is.</p>
				<p>During this hackathon, we created an early version of what is currently known as AndroidWearLift. WatchMe was the android implementation of AndroidWearLift before we decided to strip out our logic and make it a library. You can read about the details of the library above, or at the github repository <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/AndroidWearLift">here</a>.</p>

				<b>Muse Music Player</b> - WearHacks
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>WearHacks was a hackathon that focused on the use of leading wearable technology. Some devices made available to us were the Nod Ring, the Myo armband and even the Muse Brain Sensing Headband. Out of all the innovative wearable tech available, my team decided to work with the Muse.</p>
				<p>With the Muse, we wanted to create something simple and smart. The muse is able to read brainwaves, which means that it can, to an extent, read a person's behaviour or emotion. We decided to make a music player that will automatically generate an ideal playlist for a user based on previous analysis performed while they listened to various tracks.</p>
				<p> This is how it worked:</p>
				<li>A user will listen to each song in the list once.</li>
				<li>Using the Muse, we will record and determine if the user has enjoyed the song or not.</li>
				<li>After the user has finished listening to all the songs, the app will take all the songs with the highest scores and add them to the ideal playlist.</li>
				<p>In order to determine how different brainwaves (alpha, beta, gamma, etc) map to behaviour, we performed a number of tests with an individual wearing the device. We then recorded the muse readings and used <b>Matlab</b> and differential calculus to remove noise and analyze the signals. In the end, we were able to somewhat determine a general idea of what signal patterns map to the emotion "Joy".</p>
				<p>In the end, we didnt have time to complete the project (we realized that we weren't using the correct android library version, so it didn't fully work), but we had gained practical experience in signal analysis, which was still a very valuable asset in my opinion.</p>

				<b>ChallengeHub</b> - BattleHack (See the project <a href="https://github.com/karanbirrandhawa/challenge-site">here</a>)
			</div>
			<div class="section-description">
				<p>At BattleHack, we wanted to solve a problem that we've experienced. We wanted to create a more efficient and solid way of assessing a developer's skills that will replace the nerve-racking whiteboard interviews. We realized that a lot of very skilled developers may not perform at their best during the pressure of a whiteboard test in an interview. What we created was a way to assess the potential employee using a company's own code base.</p>
				<p>ChallengeHub is a github integrated application that allows for companies to send out "Challenges" with an option of a monetary incentive. These challenges would be a chance to fix a but or add a new feature to the company's open source code. It was created using <b>ReactJS</b> for frontend, and <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> as a backend. <b>Braintree</b> was also integrated as the payment system.</p>
				<p>In the perspective of an employer, they would benefit from the ability to test a developer in the environment where they will be working. Being able to see the exact implementation style of a potential developer is a great asset for an employer. Developers would also benefit from having their full skills exposed by showing what they can do in an real development environment.</p>
